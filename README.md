# Irai issue bot

Discord bot with utilities specifically for the support server of [Irai](https://github.com/osu-irai).

Mostly a copy of Bathbot-Helper by [Max Ohn](https://github.com/MaxOhn), but is public (with permission) and slightly tweaked

# Running

1. Make a RON config file based on configuration.ron

2. Run `issue-bot -c /path/to/cfg.ron`
